When we are children, pain seems simple. We know that cutting a finger or scraping knee is painful because the body has been damaged.  

But parents know this isn't the whole story. 

Different children react to the same injury in different ways. And a single child may change their response from one day to the next. When happy or distracted, playing a game, a game a child may not even notice an injury. But if they are bored, upset, or anxious, the same child will find even minor scrapes painful.






How we feel changes our pain
******************************

Over the last 20 years, scientists' understanding of pain has changed. 

We now know that the link between our emotions and pain is not just 'in the head'. How we think and and feel has a big impact on our bodies, and can cause major changes to the physiology of injuries. 


This is what everyone needs to know:

Why does this matter?
*******************************

Everybody hurts, sometimes. 

Our bodies are incredibly tough, but sometimes we damage them through accidents or need surgery to correct problems that develop.

Painkilling drugs are an important part of treatment, and used properly can be very effective.  `Find out more about using painkillers properly <painkillers>`_.

But drugs aren't the only way to reduce pain, and other techniques can make painkillers more effective. 


.. container:: admonition

	Relaxation, reducing anxiety, and positive suggestions, are recommended by NICE and pain experts as part of the standard treatment following surgery. 



Pears is desgined to make these techniques easy to apply in hospital, and after you go home.
