As children, pain seems simple. We know that cutting a finger or scraping knee is painful because the body has been damaged.  

But parents know this isn't the whole story. 

Different children react to the same injury in different ways. And a single child may change their response from one day to the next. When happy or distracted, playing a game, a game a child may not even notice an injury. But if they are bored, upset, or anxious, the same child will find even minor scrapes painful.




How we feel changes our pain
******************************

Over the last 20 years, scientists' understanding of pain has changed. 

We now know that the link between our emotions and pain is not just 'in the head'. How we think and and feel has a big impact on our bodies, and can cause major changes to the physiology of injuries. 


This is what everyone needs to know:  


1. Injuries doesn't always cause pain
2. Pain isn't always caused by an injury
3. There are powerful paways to reduce pain by changing how we think and feel.





Why does this matter?
*******************************


Everybody hurts, sometimes. 

Our bodes are incredibly tough, but sometimes we damage them through accidents, or need surgery to correct problems that develop.
