Our breathing is closely linked to our emotions. 

When we're anxious we might breathe quickly. When frightened we might hold our breath. When we're calm, safe, and relaxed we breathe slowly and deeply. Breathing is also one of the few bodily functions that can be both automatic, or voluntary. It can happen without us paying attention, but we can also control and slow it down our breath as we choose.

**Slowing our breath and breathing deeply are strong signals to our brain that we are safe, and that all is well.**

Below is a short extract from our relaxed breathing recording. You can listen to this clip to get an idea of what is involved:
