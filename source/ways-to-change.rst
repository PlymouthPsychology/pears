Easy ways to be more comfortable after surgery
===================================================

The basic science of pain suggests that after an operation, in addition to useing painkilling medication effectively, we should:

1. Relax
2. Stay calm
3. Remain postive
4. Keep moving


We know from clinical experience that patients who do this feel less pain, recover faster, and have better outcomes from their surgery.

There are many ways in which we can change the way we think and feel. Relaxation and positive suggestions are two methods which have been studied and found to benefit many patients after surgery: relaxation and positive suggestion.
