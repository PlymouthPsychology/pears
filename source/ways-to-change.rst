Ways to be more comfortable after surgery
===================================================

As we have seen, the pain we feel is strongly influenced by the way we think and feel about it.

We can reduce our pain by relaxing, staying calm, and remaining positive. It also helps to keep moving, even when we feel discomfort. 


**We know from experience and research that patients who do this feel less pain and recover faster from their surgery.**


After an operation, and in an unfamiliar setting, it can be hard to relax and pain can make us reluctant to move. Audio recordings of relaxation scripts and positive suggestions have been found to benefit many patients after surgery. 

**Relaxation and positive suggestion can help patients stay calm and positive during times of discomfort, and keep their recovery on track.**
