Ways to be more comfortable after surgery
===================================================

Pain experts recommend that, in addition to using pain-killing medication, patients recovering from surgery must:


1. Relax
2. Stay calm
3. Remain postive
4. Keep moving



We know from experience that patients who do this feel less pain and recover faster after their surgery.

Relaxation and positive suggestions are two methods which have been studied and found to benefit many patients after surgery. Both can help patients stay calm and positive during times of discomfort, and keep recovery on track.
