Pain after surgery varies, and different painkilling drugs can be used depending on the severity.

**Some pain is normal, but used properly painkillers you should prevent severe pain, or pain which causes distress.**







Which drugs will be best?
-------------------------------

To decide which type of painkiller is best, your doctor or nurse may use a tool called the analgesic ladder. The ladder shows each level of pain and the type of painkillers that are best to control it.


- Mild pain, Step one includes non-opioid drugs for example paracetamol and anti-inflammatory drugs (Brufen®, Neurofen®).

- Moderate pain, Step two includes weak opioid drugs for example dihydrocodeine (DF118 Forte®, DHC Continus®), codeine phosphate or tramadol.

- Moderate to severe pain, Step three includes strong opioid drugs for example morphine, fentanyl and oxycodone.


Different painkillers do different things and are sometimes used in combination. For example, non-opioid painkillers are often used alongside weak or strong opioids.

**The goal of treatment is not eliminate all pain, but to make sure it does not cause you distress.**





Common worries about painkillers
-----------------------------------

Many patients worry either that:

- They will become addicted to painkillers they take in hospital or
- If they take too many painkillers, they will become less effective (tolerance)
  

However, used properly painkillers are safe and effective and the risk of pain which is not controlled are much higher because if you are in pain you are likely to reduce movement and exercise.



Addiction/dependence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some drugs, especially opioids, can be addicitive, but when used properly, the risk of becoming addicted to painkilling drugs is very low.
