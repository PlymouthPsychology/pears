Keeping mobile
============================

Relaxing and staying calm are important to reduce pain, but can also help you keep moving.

**Staying mobile is the most important thing you can do to improve your recovery**

To begin with, you will be given gentle exercises in bed to regain full movement of the joint and build muscle strength.

You will be moved onto weight bearing exercises as soon as possible, but this will depend on the kind of surgery you have had and your general health.

Before you leave the hospital, your physiotherapist will show you a variety of exercises designed to help you regain mobility and strength in your joint. You should be able to perform these exercises at home. 


Sometimes, when a joint is painful, patients avoid these movements and exercises.  Relaxation and positive suggestions may help to reduce your pain, and increase the range movement in your joint.
