Pears is a quick course to reduce pain after surgery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This guide is a prototype specifically designed for patients undergoing joint replacement. Our aims are to:

1. Provide information about recovering from surgery
2. Explain how pain works, what it means, and how it can affect recovery
3. Teach you how to reduce your pain after joint surgery




.. admonition:: Key messages from the course

   1. Some pain after surgery is to be expected
   2. How we think and feel has a big impact on our pain
   3. Relaxation and positive suggestion can help reduce pain, alongside painkilling drugs.
   4. Simple techniques (like imagining a safe and peaceful place) are easy to do, and can help before or after surgery.
