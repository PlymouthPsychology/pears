**Pears is a brief intervention to help people manage pain after surgery.**

This guide is a prototype specifically designed for patients undergoing joint replacement. Our aims are to:

1. Provide information about recovering from surgery
2. Explain how pain works, what it means, and how it can affect recovery
3. Teach you how to reduce your pain after joint surgery
