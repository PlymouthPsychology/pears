When we are anxious or upset we sometimes become tense. This can make us feel less relaxed, and lead to a cycle in which we tense our muscles more and more, and become increasingly anxious.  Progressive muscle relaxation can help you notice and release this tension by deliberately tensing and then releasing different parts of the body in turn. 

**Relaxing our muscles signals to the brain that we are safe, and that we should feel calm and at rest.**

Below is a short extract from our full body relaxation recording. You can listen to this clip to get an idea of what is involved:
