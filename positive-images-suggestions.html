<h2>Introduction to suggestion<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-suggestion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can relax and use positive images and suggestions almost anywhere — whether lying down, sitting in a chair, or walking. Many people learn to use relaxation an positive imagery throughout their day — even during activities like physiotherapy or exercise.</p>
<p>To begin with though, it will help to find somehwere comfortable, and where you&#8217;re not likely to be distracted.
A bed or comfortable chair is ideal.
Using headphones is helpful to reduce distractions.
During relaxation exercises it can also help to keep walm, and so you might like to cover yourself with a blanket or duvet.</p>
<p>How we think and and feel has a big impact on our bodies, and using relaxation and suggestion can help us recover more quickly.</p>
<p>In this recording, we use relaxation and positive suggestion to become calm, and to increase your comfort after surgery.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll begin by practicing the &#8216;safe and peaceful place&#8217; exercise. When you&#8217;re relaxed and comfortable, we&#8217;ll use positive images and suggestions to make your [knee] more comfortable.</p>

<h2>For greater comfort in the joint<a class="headerlink" href="#for-greater-comfort-in-the-joint" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that you&#8217;re more relaxed, we&#8217;ll use images and suggestions to make your [knee] more comfortable.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve designed this recording especially for patients with a new [knee]. The idea is to let any discomfort float away, and leave you feeling fresh, and ready to move.</p>
<p>Before we start, check again that you&#8217;re comfortable, sitting or lying in a relaxed position. Your feet should be slightly apart, and your knees also slightly parted. You might find it comfortable to close your eyes.</p>
<p>First of all, bring your attention to your [knee]. Now that you&#8217;re relaxed, and feeling calm, you might notice it feeling different. If it does, that&#8217;s fine. When they relax, many people find their [knee] feels more relaxed too.</p>
<p>Start to pay a little extra attention to each of the muscles in your [knee].  Notice any of the muscles which feel warm or tense, or anything which feels out of place or bothers you.</p>
<p>If you have any swelling in your [knee] notice that. If the skin feels warm, or stretched.  If the joint feels stiff. Pay attention to all these things.</p>
<p>Spend these few moments to notice anything which feels out of the ordinary, or which is uncomfortable, and pay attention to them.</p>
<p>[short pause]</p>
<p>OK, now you&#8217;ve got a clear feeling of your [knee] and you&#8217;re ready to start, letting any feelings of discomfort, or heat, or stiffness float away.</p>
<p>With each breath you take, notice the air passing through your nose, or over your lips or mouth.</p>
<p>Breathe slowly, and evenly.</p>
<p>If the breath feels smooth as it passes notice how pleasant that can be.</p>
<p>You might find the air feels cool, and smooth, and fresh as it passes into your lungs.</p>
<p>With each breath in, imagine this cool, fresh air, moving down to your [knee].
It might feel smooth, or refreshing.</p>
<p>And with each breath out, imagine any feelings of heat or pressure pass away, taken out with your breath they float into the room.</p>
<p>Each breath you take in feels cool, fresh and smooth. You might imagine this breath entering your lungs as pale white refreshing mist.</p>
<p>Every time your breathe out, you feel the heat and warmth of your kip and knee pass out with it. You might imagine each breath out as a pale red mist, leaving your body, and carrying away any tension or heat.</p>
<p>Breathe slowly, a pale white mist on the in-breath passing down through your body, bringing a cool, refreshing, freeing sensation to your knee; a pale red mist leaving on the outbreath, carrying away any heat, or tension, or stiffness.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave you to breathe slowly and imagine for a short while. Breathing first in... and then out... smoothly... and evenly.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">short silence</p>
</div>
<p>In your mind, imagine that your knee is now relaxed, and cool. Notice the feeling of the air, or any blankets or dressing against your skin. In your mind, but without moving, imagine yourself flexing your knee. Think of the movement as smooth, and fluid. Your muscles feel strong and in control. And the movement feels easy.</p>
<p>Imagine it&#8217;s easy to move your foot backwards and forwards, flexing the knee smoothly and comfortably.</p>
<p>In your mind, the foot moves backwards... and forwards. Smoothly flexing the knee in a natural continuous movement — without effort.</p>
<p>If you imagine any discomfort, breathe in and feel the cool air, the same pale white mist, soothe the knee.</p>
<p>Slowly breathe out, and feel the tension or heat leave your body, with your breath, just as before.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to leave you to imagine these smooth, fluid movements for a short while.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">short silence</p>
</div>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve practiced moving your [knee] in your mind, you may find it helpful to imagine these smooth, steady, fluid movements when you practice your physiotherapy exercises, or at any other time during the day.</p>
<p>Before you begin your exercises remind your physio, or the person you are with, what you are doing, and ask them to give you a moment to get ready.</p>
<p>Close your eyes for a second, and cast your mind back to the safe place you imagined earlier.</p>
<p>Imagine yourself as really there. Bringing to mind the place in as vidid a way as possible — the sights, sounds, smells and sensations of being there.</p>
<p>You might notice your feelings too — that you feel safe, or calm, or happy in this peaceful place.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re ready you can begin the movements with the physio.</p>
<p>As you begin each movement, remember the strong, fluid movements you made in your mind. Imagine your [knee] moving smoothly through a full range of motion.</p>
<p>If you feel any discomfort, simply breathe in and feel the cool air travelling through your body, to your [knee].  The warm outbreath takes away and heat or tension or discomfort.</p>
<p>Imagine your knee feeling cool, strong, and relaxed, and ready to do the work.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re finished your exercises, notice how your [knee] feels.</p>
<p>If there is any tension or heat or stiffness, simply breathe this away, with cool air travelling to your [knee] in the inbreath, and warm air floating away any discomfort as you breathe out. You can use this technique as often as you like, in hospital, or at home as you recover.</p>

<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">short silence</p>
</div>
<p>This recording is now complete, so you have a choice.</p>
<p>If you like, stay lying, with your eyes closed, and continue with this slow, steady breathing for as long as you like. You might even find you become sleepy.</p>
<p>Or if you prefer, you can open your eyes now — it&#8217;s up to you.</p>
<p>Either way, this time spend relaxing, and breathing, will leave you feeling refreshed, alert and ready for the challenges of the day.</p>
